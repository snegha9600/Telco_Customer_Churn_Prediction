# Telco_Customer_Churn_Prediction

This project uses a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn or not, based on the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

## Model Highlights

- Model: Random Forest Classifier
- Accuracy: 79% 
- Target: `Churn`


## Files Included

- `churn_prediction.ipynb` – Full notebook (EDA, preprocessing, model, evaluation)
- `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` – Original dataset
- `churn_model.pkl` – Saved trained model
- `scaler.pkl` – Saved StandardScaler
- `README.md` – Project overview

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install required libraries:  
   `pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook
4. Run all cells
